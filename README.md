# dapp-init
Decentralized application for voting.

The purpose of the project is to introduce the basic concept of Blockchain technology
and give the opportunity to understand how you can use the features of this technology
to solve different problems. For this, you will need to write several smart contracts that
allow you to store user data and use unique users for voting.

1. Start Ganashe (Ethereum client).
2. truffle migrate --reset (compile and send contracts to network).
3. truffle test
